"""End-to-end verification of sudo/su elevation on an installed LeonOS 4 disk.

Boots a scratch disk installed from the current installer ISO, logs into the
desktop as the ordinary account, and drives the Terminal through the QMP
keyboard. This is the only check that can prove the privileged broker really
changes an identity: the host suites prove the authorization decisions, but not
that the guest performs a setuid-free elevation through authd.

Keyboard fidelity matters here. `sendkey` needs an explicit QEMU key name for
every punctuation character, so this module supplies the full map instead of
relying on the base helper's partial one; an unmapped character silently splits
the command line and would make the test blame the shell.

The oracle is the screenshot, not the serial log: Terminal renders the PTY
output into its window and never writes it to the serial console, so a serial
scrape would see nothing and a screenshot shows the actual result. Each step
therefore types a command, waits, and captures a frame; the frames are the
evidence this run leaves behind.

Ordering is deliberate: the first frame must show the ordinary account,
otherwise nothing below proves anything about privilege. The password is typed
at the guest terminal rather than piped, because sudo and su read the terminal
directly and that is also what makes the echo-suppression claim meaningful.
